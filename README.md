This code demonstrates a subtle type error in TypeScript related to type coercion during arithmetic operations.  The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the call to `add(5, '10')` passes a string, which TypeScript implicitly coerces to a number. While this compiles without error, it results in unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to improve type safety using type guards.
